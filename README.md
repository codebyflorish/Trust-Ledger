## Smart Contract Structure (Clarity)

```clarity
(define-map invoices
  { id: uint }
  {
    issuer: principal,
    recipient: principal,
    amount: uint,
    status: (string-ascii 20),
    issued-at: uint
  }
)

(define-public (create-invoice (id uint) (recipient principal) (amount uint))
  (begin
    (map-set invoices { id: id }
      {
        issuer: tx-sender,
        recipient: recipient,
        amount: amount,
        status: "pending",
        issued-at: block-height
      })
    (ok true)
  )
)
```

> *Note: Full smart contract code and unit tests are available in the `contracts/` directory.*
